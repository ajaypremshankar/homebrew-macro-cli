# Developing

## Clean and Rebuild the Environment
Remove any previous build artifacts and rebuild the package. This can often resolve residual issues:

```bash
# Remove previous build files if they exist
rm -rf build/ dist/ *.egg-info
```

## Rebuild the package
```bash
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

4. Ensure Virtual Environment and Python Version Compatibility
If you’re working in a virtual environment, ensure it’s active. If you’re not, it’s best practice to create one, especially if other installed packages might be conflicting.

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
```

5. Build and Install the Package Locally
Try building and installing the package again within the virtual environment:

```bash
pip install dist/macro-cli-1.0.tar.gz
```
This process should resolve most common wheel-building issues. Let me know if these steps help or if any errors persist—additional configuration may be required if specific errors continue.
